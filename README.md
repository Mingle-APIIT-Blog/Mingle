## Introduction
This repository consists of my contribution to an agile-based blog platform built using HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and PhpMyAdmin. The project follows the agile methodology, with the team progressing through agile phases that include project planning, requirement gathering & analysis, sprint planning, sprints and reviews.

Currently, the repository contains the shippable product of Sprint 1, which includes essential features such as user authentication and authorization, as well as blog management functionalities (CRUD operations). Users can sign up, log in securely, and manage their blogs seamlessly through this platform.

Our team is dedicated to delivering a user-friendly and robust blogging experience.

#### Personalized Features
In Sprint 2, we are integrating content recommendation and faculty-based blog categorization to enhance user experience and satisfaction.

**Content Recommendation:** 
This feature provides users with personalized blog recommendations based on their registered faculty. It dynamically retrieves blog posts relevant to the user's faculty and displays them on the homepage in descending order based on upload time.

**Faculty-based Blog Categorization:** 
Users can select categories for their blog posts based on their registered faculty. Categories are unique to different faculties, ensuring that content is organized logically and users can quickly identify relevant posts.

Through these personalized features, we aim to provide a tailored and efficient blogging experience for our users.
